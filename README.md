# home-remote-ios

I created home-remote to interface with a Raspberry Pi remote I built that controls my home projector and sound system. The backend is powered by [this app](https://github.com/jhulley/home-remote-node/tree/master) I built in Node.js.

You can read more about my home-remote project ... Coming soon.
